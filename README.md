CamSpy

CamSpy is an automation script for the fswebcam program on Linux(install via terminal
using "sudo apt install fswebcam"). The code prompts you for directory and resolution, and the default 
file type is JPEG, but can be altered by changing the code.

The primary use is for guarding Linux systems, lawful espionage using a discrete quotidien object,
and making sure employees are actually doing work. Versions for Windows and Mac are on the way, using different 
base programs.
